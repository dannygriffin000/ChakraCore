
I. write program to map table to actual character code equivalence classes (sort equivalence by codepoint, display each set only once (by lowest code point)

II. Regenerate the source table from UnicodeData-8.0.0.txt and CaseMapping-8.0.0.txt
Ensure that program I. generates the same output from the original table and the table generated from II.

IIb. Run II with UnicodeData-9.0.0.txt and CaseMapping-9.0.0.txt.


Note:

skip 2 has special rules, always has entry -1, 1, 1, 1
It is always the case that these entries are case-equivalent for subsequent entries, e.g.


0x0100 == 0x0101
0x0102 == 0x0103
etc.
